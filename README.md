# Sid Meier's Colonization (1994) SAV files utility pack

The aim of this work is to make study and edit process of SAV files easy and comfortable. The ultimate goal is to fully describe SAV file structure, outline it in universal format and prepare utility pack for working with SAV files for enhancing the gameplay of this brilliant game.

What is being done:
- outline the SAV file structure in easy readable and editable universal JSON format
- utility for parsing binary SAV file data and saving it to human readable/editable JSON format
- utility for reading SAV file data FROM human readable/editable JSON format and writing it back to native SAV format
- utility for editing SAV files (certain fields such as: remove stokade, arm indian converts, plant forests etc)

Files:
* smcol_sav_struct.json - SAV file structure outline in JSON format.
The structure itself was copied from (viceroy)[https://github.com/hegemogy/viceroy] and adapted to JSON format. Thanks to **eb4x** and **hegemogy** for their great and thoroughful work!
